	<p>There's no place like home. As cliche as it may sound, there really is no place like home. As a senior in highschool there are many new things that await me in the current year, one being moving away from my home, and moving into a new home. Aside from all the furniture, decorations, electronics and materialistic belongings I think the most important aspect of a home are the people you live with, your family. Whether they are blood related or not. I’ve been fortunate enough to have grown up in a kind and loving home with a great family that is very close and tight knit. I do not define my home as a structure or an address but wherever my family is where my real home also is. There’s a reason why many of us get homesick when we are away for a long time, sure you miss your bed, and your video games etc. But I think most of all we miss our parents, our siblings, and our friends. I’ll miss my parents home cooking, my grandmothers hugs, and hanging out with my brothers and cousins. Luckily for me I plan on moving in with 4 of my best friends so I don’t think I’ll too rough a time transitioning to college life because I’ll just be moving in another home, with my new “family”. Sure a big house is a great thing to have, but what is it if you have no one to share that space with? To have big dinners with family and friends, and invite them over for parties. Home is where the heart is, and my heart is with my friends and family.</p>
